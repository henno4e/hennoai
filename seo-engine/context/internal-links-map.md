## Linking Strategy

### From Every Article, Link To:
1. **Homepage** (1x) — when mentioning Henno AI, the business, or the service offering
2. **Booking page** (1–2x) — via CTAs throughout the article
3. **Blog listing** (1x) — breadcrumb "Back to blog" link (handled by template)
4. **2–3 related blog posts** — as the blog grows, cross-link topically related articles

### Topic Clusters (Build Over Time)

As the blog grows, organize posts into clusters. Each cluster has a pillar page and supporting articles that link to each other.

**Planned Clusters:**

1. **AI Automation Basics** (pillar: "What is AI Automation for Small Business?")
   - What tasks to automate first
   - AI automation ROI calculator
   - Common automation mistakes
   - AI tools comparison guides

2. **Industry Guides** (pillar per industry)
   - Restaurants / Cloud kitchens
   - Professional services (accounting, legal, real estate)
   - E-commerce / Retail
   - Healthcare / Wellness

3. **AI Tools & How-Tos** (pillar: "Best AI Tools for Small Business")
   - ChatGPT for business
   - AI chatbots for customer service
   - Automated email/scheduling
   - AI for social media

4. **Business Growth with AI** (pillar: "How to Scale with AI")
   - Hiring vs automating
   - Customer experience automation
   - Sales automation
   - Operations efficiency

### Cross-Linking Rules
- Link to the pillar page from every cluster article
- Link between related cluster articles (minimum 2 cross-links)
- Update older articles to link to newer related content
- Use varied, descriptive anchor text (not the same phrase every time)
