## Audience

**Primary**: Small business owners and operators who are curious about AI but overwhelmed by the hype. They've heard about ChatGPT and automation but don't know where to start or what's actually worth their time. They're practical, time-poor, and skeptical of silver bullets.

**Secondary**: Operations managers, marketing leads, and team leads at small businesses who handle the day-to-day and see the bottlenecks firsthand.

**What they care about**: Saving time, cutting costs, not falling behind competitors, practical ROI.

**What they fear**: Wasting money on tools that don't work, looking foolish, losing control, AI replacing their judgment.

## Voice Pillars

### 1. Practical
Show, don't tell. Lead with specific examples, real numbers, and concrete outcomes. "We automated invoice processing for a Cape Town restaurant — cut 6 hours/week to 20 minutes" beats "AI can transform your business."

### 2. Authoritative
Speak from experience, not theory. Reference real client work, specific tools, and actual results. No hedging with "could potentially" — state what works and what doesn't.

### 3. Conversational
Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend over coffee. Use contractions. Ask questions. Keep sentences short. No jargon — if you must use a technical term, explain it immediately.

### 4. Results-Focused
Every piece of content should connect back to a business outcome: time saved, money saved, revenue gained, errors eliminated. If you can't tie a point to a result, cut it.

### GEO Voice Balance
Most of each article uses our conversational brand voice. However, for AI-extractable content (quotable capsules, FAQ answers, statistical claims), shift to a slightly more neutral, factual tone. This ensures AI engines can cite our content directly while the overall article still sounds like us. The conversational voice wraps around the quotable blocks, not the other way around.

## Tone Guidelines

| Content Type | Tone Adjustment |
|---|---|
| How-to guides | Teacher mode: clear, step-by-step, patient |
| Strategy articles | Advisor mode: confident, opinionated, decisive |
| Case studies | Storyteller mode: vivid, specific, outcome-driven |
| FAQ/Explainers | Friendly expert: simple language, no condescension |

## Writing Rules

- **Use contractions**: "you'll" not "you will", "it's" not "it is"
- **Address the reader**: "you" and "your", not "one" or "businesses"
- **Be specific**: "saves 4 hours per week" not "saves significant time"
- **Be direct**: "Here's how to do it" not "In this article, we'll explore how..."
- **Use active voice**: "AI handles your invoices" not "Your invoices are handled by AI"
- **Keep paragraphs short**: 2–4 sentences max

## CTA Strategy

All CTAs point to the chatbot widget (primary) or `/#book` (fallback). The chatbot handles qualification and booking automatically.

| CTA Type | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Soft | After first value section (~500 words) | "Want to see what this looks like for your business? [Chat with us →]" |
| Medium | After comparison/proof section | "We'll map out your automation opportunities in 30 minutes. [Book your free audit →]" |
| Strong | End of article | "Ready to stop doing work a machine should handle? [Get your free automation audit →]" |
