# Henno AI — Style Guide

## Paragraph Structure

- **Max 4 sentences** per paragraph — most should be 2–3
- **Vary paragraph length** — mix 1-sentence punches with 3-sentence explanations
- **One idea per paragraph** — if you're making a new point, start a new paragraph
- **White space is your friend** — when in doubt, break it up

## Sentence Structure

- **Vary length**: Mix short (5–10 words) with medium (15–20) and occasional long (25–30)
- **Lead with the point**: "AI handles your invoices automatically" not "By leveraging AI technology, your invoices can be handled automatically"
- **Active voice default**: "The chatbot books meetings" not "Meetings are booked by the chatbot"
- **Passive is OK when**: The actor doesn't matter or you're emphasizing the result

## Formatting Rules

### Bold
- Use **bold** for key terms being introduced, important numbers, or critical points
- Don't bold entire sentences — bold the 2–4 most important words
- Max 3–4 bold instances per section

### Lists
- Use bulleted lists for unordered items (features, benefits, tips)
- Use numbered lists only for sequential steps
- List items: Keep parallel structure (all start with verbs, or all start with nouns)
- 3–7 items per list — fewer is usually better

### Blockquotes
- Use for client quotes, key takeaways, or important callouts
- Keep to 1–2 sentences
- Don't overuse — max 2 per article

### Subheadings
- Every 120–180 words
- Write as complete thoughts, not single words ("How AI Chatbots Handle Booking" not "Chatbots")
- Include keywords naturally — don't keyword-stuff headings
- Use question format when targeting featured snippets
- Frame as questions matching user search intent when possible
- Keep under 60 characters

## AI Pattern Avoidance

### Phrases to Never Use
These are dead giveaways of AI-generated content. Never use them:

- "In today's [fast-paced/digital/modern] world..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "It's worth mentioning..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "In this article, we'll explore..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Look no further..."
- "Game-changer" / "Game-changing"
- "Cutting-edge" / "State-of-the-art"
- "Revolutionize" / "Revolutionary"
- "Harness the power of..."
- "Unlock the potential of..."
- "Seamless" / "Seamlessly"
- "Robust" / "Comprehensive" (as filler adjectives)
- "Landscape" (as in "the AI landscape")
- "Navigate the complexities"
- "Empower" / "Empowering"
- "Delve into"
- "Tapestry"
- "Multifaceted"
- "Crucial" / "Pivotal" / "Paramount"
- "Moreover" / "Furthermore" / "Additionally" (as paragraph starters)

### Transition Fixes
Instead of robotic transitions, use:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| "Furthermore..." | "And..." or just start the next point |
| "Moreover..." | "Here's the thing:" or "Plus:" |
| "Additionally..." | "On top of that," or "There's more:" |
| "In conclusion..." | "So here's the takeaway:" or just summarize |
| "It's worth noting that..." | State the fact directly |
| "However..." (overused) | "But" or restructure the sentence |
| "Therefore..." | "So" or "That means" |

### Em-Dash Rules
Em-dashes (—) are OK in moderation but AI overuses them. Rules:
- **Max 2 em-dashes per article** (yes, really — two total)
- Replace most with: commas, periods, semicolons, or parentheses
- Never use em-dashes for attribution ("Text — Author" → "Text, Author")
- If you've used 2 already, restructure the sentence instead

### Natural Writing Markers
Include these to sound human:
- **Contractions**: Always use them (you'll, it's, don't, we're, that's)
- **Sentence fragments**: Occasional. For emphasis. Like this.
- **Parenthetical asides**: (the ones nobody asked for but everyone needs)
- **Direct address**: "You know that feeling when..." or "Here's what most people miss:"
- **Specific numbers**: "saves 4.5 hours per week" not "saves hours of time"
- **Named examples**: "Like Sarah's bakery in Stellenbosch" not "like many small businesses"
- **Freshness signals**: Include "Last updated: [date]" and reference current year data

## GEO Writing Patterns

### Answer-First Structure
Every H2 section must open with a 1–2 sentence direct answer (40–60 words) before expanding with evidence and examples. This is the most extractable content for AI engines.

**Pattern:**
```
## How much does AI automation cost for small businesses?

Most small businesses spend R500–R2,000 per month on AI automation tools, with setup costs ranging from R5,000–R25,000 depending on complexity. The ROI typically appears within 2–3 months through time savings alone.

[Then expand with details, examples, mini-stories...]
```

### Inline Citation Format
When citing statistics or research, name the source explicitly in the text. AI engines extract and attribute these citations directly.

| Do This | Not This |
|---|---|
| "According to a 2025 Gartner report, 67% of small businesses..." | "67% of small businesses use AI ([source](link))" |
| "Research from McKinsey shows that automation reduces costs by 30%" | "Automation reduces costs by 30%" |
| "A Stanford study found that AI chatbots handle 80% of queries" | "AI chatbots can handle most queries" |

### Quotable Capsules
Write 3–5 self-contained paragraphs per 1,000 words (40–100 words each) that pass the attribution test: could an AI engine prefix this with "According to henno.ai:" and have it make complete sense? These capsules should contain a specific claim, a number, and stand alone without context.

### Self-Referential Language Ban
Never use these phrases — they break modular extraction by AI engines:
- "As mentioned above..."
- "As discussed earlier..."
- "In the section below..."
- "As we'll see later..."
- "Refer to the previous section..."
- "The above table shows..."

Each paragraph must work as a standalone excerpt.

### Neutral Tone for Quotable Blocks
For statistics and factual claims that AI engines might cite, use neutral phrasing:

| For Quotable Blocks | For Conversational Sections |
|---|---|
| "Research indicates that..." | "Here's the thing:" |
| "Data from [Source] shows..." | "We've seen this with our clients:" |
| "Studies demonstrate that..." | "In our experience..." |

Balance: Most of the article uses our conversational brand voice. Quotable capsules use slightly more neutral, factual tone so they're extractable.

## Formatting Consistency

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine, use digits for 10+
- Always use digits for: percentages (5%), money ($500), time (3 hours), measurements
- Use commas in large numbers: 10,000 not 10000

### Punctuation
- Oxford comma: Yes, always
- Exclamation marks: Never in body copy. Only in CTAs if it fits the energy.
- Ellipses: Rarely. One per article max.
- Colons: Use before lists or when introducing a key point

### Capitalization
- Headings: Sentence case ("How AI chatbots save time" not "How AI Chatbots Save Time")
- Product names: As branded (ChatGPT, Cal.com, Zapier)
- "AI": Always capitalized
- "henno.ai": Lowercase h when referring to the domain

## Content Quality Markers

### What Makes Great Content
- Opens with something unexpected or specific
- Every paragraph earns its place (could you cut it without losing value?)
- Includes at least 2 things the reader hasn't seen in other articles on this topic
- Ends with a clear next step, not a vague summary
- Reads out loud without sounding like a robot

### Red Flags to Self-Check
- Same sentence structure repeated 3+ times in a row
- A paragraph that's all abstract with no concrete example
- Using "many" or "significant" instead of a specific number
- Opening a section with a definition instead of a hook
- More than 2 consecutive sentences starting with the same word
